                            Hi, I'm Lucas Ackman. I'm a video game engineer and designer. While I consider myself
                            primarily as someone who works in the development stages in the engine, I never turn down
                            the
                            opportunity to design gameplay when given the chance. My expertise lies within the Unity 
			    Game Engine, although I am quick to pick up on new technologies as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But who I am is a whole different story. Long story short: I grew up in a small town with
                            dreams to bring children the entertainment I grew up with, that being movies or games.
                            Ultimately, I went down the games route because I can still tell stories and craft
                            narritives through games.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since childhood I've always been really good with numbers, which naturally lead to being
                            good with computers considering how often I spent my free time tinkering and trying to mod
                            some of my favorite games. Over time, I learned the basics of what I was doing and wanted to
                            learn more in depth which brought me to university where I realized just how much I didn't
                            know yet.
                        </p>
