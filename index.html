                                        Hi, I'm Lucas Ackman. I'm a video game engineer and designer. While I consider myself
                                        primarily as someone who works in the development stages in the engine, I never turn down
                                        the opportunity to design gameplay when given the chance. My expertise lies within the Unity 
                                        Game Engine, although I am quick to pick up on new technologies as well.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For example, web development! I'm no expert in web development. I went to school to learn
                                        how to make video games after all. However, doing that meant learning a good chunk of
                                        more generalized programming and I've used those skills to get my foot in the door for web
                                        development and pick up the basics on developing dynamic webpages to build this portfolio 
                                        webpage myself. I look forward to the opportunity to learn more regarding how I could 
                                        develop webpages in an efficient and productive way.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But who I am is a whole different story. If you want an overly simplistic version, I grew 
                                        up in a small town with big dreams to bring children the entertainment I grew up with, that 
                                        being movies or games. Ultimately, I went down the games route because I can still tell 
                                        stories and craft narritives through games while still using my skills in programming and 
                                        mathematics. Ever since, I've been learning all that I can to create interactive experiences,
                                        primarily video games, although as previously mentioned I have picked up the basics of web
                                        development as well.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Since childhood I've always been really good with numbers, which naturally lead to being
                                        good with computers considering how often I spent my free time tinkering and trying to mod
                                        some of my favorite games. Over time, I learned the basics of what I was doing and wanted to
                                        learn more in depth which brought me to university where I realized just how much I didn't
                                        know yet.
                                    </p>
