            <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                The Ecology Simulation is a project that I made as a part of my software engineering course during
                university. This is less of a game and more of a simulation meant to be used for educational purposes to
                better understand how small changes in populations could modify the outcome of an ecosystem.

            <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Contributions and Responsibilities</h4>
            <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                I was the primary developer in this project. I had six other teammates but I was the only person with
                prior experience using the Unity Engine, so I did end up with a majority of the work. I created the AI
                for the foxes as well as the carrots and walked my teammate through development of the rabbit. I also
                developed the interactions between the different species and the user interface.

            <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Challenges Faced</h4>
            <ol>
                <li class="text-primary">
                    While working on the fox AI, I needed a way for foxes to see the rabbits in front of them rather
                    than simply targeting the closest rabbit, as that rabbit could be behind it.
                </li>
                <li class="text-primary">
                    Throughout development, I had to ensure that the systems developed by everyone on the team would
                    work cleanly together. This ultimately cost a lot of time, but was worth it in the end.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="border-top border-bottom mt-4 mb-4"></div>
            <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Lessons Learned</h4>
            <ol>
                <li class="text-primary">
                    Ultimately, the system would collect all the potential prey within a circle around it, then filter
                    that list down according to the angle made by the vector connecting the two mobs and the forward
                    of the hunter. This way, I could ensure that animals could only make decisions based on what would
                    be realistically seen by them while also allowing different species to see different things. We used
                    that specifically to make the rabbits have a much wider angle of vision than the foxes because they
                    have eyes on the sides of their heads as a prey, whereas the foxes had eyes in the front as
                    predators.
                </li>
                <li class=" text-primary">
                    This was my first project where I served as a project lead. I learned to take into consideration the
                    experience of everyone in the team rather than basing project specifications on my own skills and
                    abilities because ultimately I cannot expect them to match up. My most valuable lesson was to be
                    patient with some team members as they may still need to pick up the software and understand it.

                                "Lucas used his knowledge of programming conventions in the Unity engine to guide this
                                project's development. This guidance was a vital part of the development process, and
                                each developer used it to make code that worked together as a coherent system, even in
                                the limited timeframe we had.</p>
