                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    A Statue of Time was the first project that I had programmed entirely on my own. It was a class
                    project that lasted about half the semester. You control a character that was cursed to turn to
                    stone and view his statues but he uses this curse to escape the tower he is trapped in. By turning
                    to stone, your statues can press buttons, weigh down pulleys, and give access to difficult to reach
                    locations.

                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    I provided all of the programming for A Statue of Time using the Unity Engine and the pre-existing
                    Unity components. This project was created with a team of 2, where I initially served as the
                    programmer and my partner would develop the art, but we realized we needed someone to make levels. I
                    took a major role in level development and developed thirteen of the total levels.

                <ol>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        One of the biggest problems was level development. I had never been able to creatively design
                        levels that could make a player reconsider their abilities and do something new. I needed to
                        find a way to make players think about their ability options in new ways that they perhaps
                        hadn't considered prior.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        On the tech side, I had a major problem that was unable to be solved during development time,
                        but if I were to rework it today I would have the solution. If you were to walk on a pulley and
                        walk over the edge of it while barely staying on it, the pulley would start pulling down for no
                        reason. I was able to slow it down and make it less noticable, but this project was before I
                        learned any of the Unity Physics Engine so I wasn't using any joints which is what caused the
                        bug.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <div class="border-top border-bottom mt-4 mb-4"></div>
                <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Lessons Learned</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        When working on the level design, I thought about what I could do to create unique use cases for
                        the abilitites. One of the levels I'm most proud of involves a button that opens the exit but
                        you aren't able to reach the button without holding another button down. However, you only have
                        one statue to use in this level, which makes the solution quite a sparking moment for the player
                        when they discover it. To come up with this, I thought about the mechanics and considered how
                        they might be able to interact with each other, which lead to the piston interacting with a
                        statue which lead to the solution for this level.
                    </li>
                    <li class=" text-primary">
                        Were I to create this game now, I would use a configurable joint for the pulleys isntead of
                        manually controlling the position through a direct modification of the transform values. Using
                        the joint would solve this because I would lock all the rotations and positions except for the y
                        position. Then, I would simply modify the maxDistance value based on the mass of the rigidbodies
                        on top of it, and I would configure the settings on the joint to prevent rapid movement, making
                        all movement be at the same speed.

                                "At the end of working on Blacksite Theta, the project tech lead and I were reflecting
                                on how the project had gone. We both agreed that we wouldn’t have been able to complete
                                the project without Lucas. Right from the beginning, Lucas took charge of the
                                physics-based movement system for the player.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was easily the most challenging system to program in the game, and Lucas dedicated
                                himself to working through all various twists and turns that come with such an endeavor.
                                This alone would have made Lucas one of the most valuable members of the team. In
                                addition to this, whenever he wasn’t working on the movement system, he was quick to
                                help out with other areas of the project including helping team members with less
                                experience when they ran into trouble.
                            </p>

                                I would be more than happy to have Lucas on any team I worked on in the future."
