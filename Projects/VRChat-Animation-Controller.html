                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    The animation controller was created because I played quite a lot of the video game VRChat with a
                    custom avatar, specifically in a Spider-Man web swinging themed world. Many players used full body
                    tracking to recreate iconic poses while swinging around the world, but due to my disability, full
                    body tracking would just showcase that I'm sitting in a chair. I wanted a way around that, so I
                    created an animation controller for my avatar that utilized parameters provided by VRChat to play
                    animations midair and mimic full body motion capture through handmade animations.

                    I created this system from scratch in the Unity Editor with the project template created for VRChat
                    avatar creation. I got my character model online, but I did personally retexture it as well as
                    produce the animations shown in the showcase images.

                    <li class="text-primary">
                        This was the first time I really wanted to explore creating my own character model, but I have
                        very little experience with 3D modelling. I've always been able to model basic shapes and items,
                        but never anything nearly as complex as a humanoid figure. While the texturing was fairly easy,
                        the animations were my biggest struggle, as I had never really created animations with the
                        intention of actually using them in a project.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        I was unable to utilize new parameters in the Unity Animator, as I was restricted to the scripts
                        and tools provided by the VRChat developers. These restrictions at the time of development were
                        including but not limited to the velocity of the player in the x, y, and z global axis or the
                        current hand pose on each hand.

                <ol>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        For the actual character model, I found a nice one online that seemed quite close to a model
                        from the Spider-Man: Miles Morales game that I liked so I downloaded it, I knew that I couldn't
                        do it myself so I outsourced. From there, I opened it in blender and cleaned it up. There were
                        many bones that I would not need or other bones that I would need to add or connect because the
                        mask was a separate mesh. Once the mesh was taken care of, I got to texturing it using blender's
                        texture node system. My animation work could definitely be improved, but it was never the
                        featured part of this project. That's why when I published the package publicly, I didn't
                        include the animations, I wanted to see others creating their own animations.
                    </li>
                    <li class=" text-primary">
                        Working within the limitations of the VRChat system was initially agrivating as I knew it would
                        be easy to implement the custom animations if I were able to add my own custom classes to
                        control animations onto the avatar but their system rightfully prevents that. After about a week
                        of working within the restrictions, I had found the solution I was looking for. I created a
                        custom animation state that the player can activate or deactivate in their hand menu. This state
                        would not play any animations directly, but it would send the player into an entirely separate
                        animation sub-tree set up for web-swinging animations. This way, players would only have
                        swinging animations on if they wanted them, without needed them on in every world. When it was
                        on, players could control the animations even further with their hand pose so that if the hand
                        is in a fist, for example, the full body animation would be in pose X but if the hands were open
                        the animation would play pose Y instead. I also used y velocity to determine which animation to
                        play, this way players who are moving downward quickly can play a diving animation but when they
                        go upwards they'll be playing a swinging animation.
