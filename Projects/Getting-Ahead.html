                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    Getting Ahead was my second of three university capstone projects. It's my first multiplayer
                    project, though luckily I had spent the previous summer break developing my Kickstarter Package
                    which included a local multiplayer input system. The primary gameplay loop consists of player
                    spawning in one room, and the players must work together to defeat all the enemies in a room before
                    they are able to move on to the next room. Whenever a player takes too much damage and dies, they
                    will be decapitated but aren't out yet, instead if there is an available body in the room they can
                    'recapitate' that body, gaining the attacks and statistics associated with the body. Players can
                    also leave their current body whenever they wish if there is a more suitable body available for
                    them, or if they wish to mess with their friends and steal a body from them.
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    Players will be assigned one of two classes randomly at the start of each game, either the melee
                    Knight / Squire or the ranged Wizard. Enemy classes will be room dependent, with each room having
                    some amount of points and will spawn enemies until it runs out of points. Enemy classes include the
                    Goblin, Salamander, Golem, and Zombie. There is friendly fire between both enemies and players,
                    encouraging players to think about how they might make enemies attack each other, while also
                    including the opprotunity for them to attack each other, creating a very playful experience.

                    This was the first large scale project on which I was the tech team lead. This meant that I was
                    responsible for ensuring that the game could be completed by managing and reworking the design to
                    fit an appropriate scope throughout the project. I was also responsible for assigning issues to each
                    member of my team at the start of each development sprint.

                    <li class="text-primary">
                        As this was my first leadership role, I had to learn how to handle assignments of issues.
                        Initially, I took the route of assigning an equal ammount of work to each person for each
                        sprint, often based on the amount of work I would be doing. I quickly realized that this meant I
                        was overworking my teammates, as they didn't have the available time that I had, and so I needed
                        a solution.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        I had to develop a whole system for how the decapitation and recapitation would function. This
                        was my most complex game mechanic that I had designed at the time, so I made sure to think about
                        it deeply before beginning the process. Ultimately, this made the system far easier to produce,
                        though with one issue that I only realized far later in development. On some cases when a player
                        would die, the decapitation would be fail somewhere, causing the body to keep moving, and the
                        head be unable to recapitate.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <div class="border-top border-bottom mt-4 mb-4"></div>
                <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Lessons Learned</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        I had taken the route of looking at each member on my team individually. I would ask them what
                        they felt comfortable working on so that I could feel confident they knew how to do it and I'd
                        also consider how long the task would likely take to complete and compare with the time per week
                        they were able to commit to the project. This ultimately balanced out development a lot better.
                        I had a lot more time available to work on the project and so I was giving myself the bigger
                        tasks in development, meanwhile the other developers would get smaller tasks to ensure that they
                        could still complete it within a single sprint.
                    </li>
                    <li class=" text-primary">
                        To develop the capitation system, I had gotten out my whiteboard and written out the step for
                        each variation of capitations, from enemy decapitations, player decapitations, and player
                        recapitations. That was the key that made developing this system so much easier. However, the
                        bug came from a remnant in the capitation system from before I had developed the enemy AI. Once
                        the AI was implemented, it revealed a bug due to player registration in the capitation
                        controller. Ultimately, it was simple to solve as it was just legacy code from before I
                        implemented AI for enemies.

                                "Working with Lucas Ackman in our Media Arts and Game Development class was a wonderful
                                experience. Working with Lucas made me feel like he trusted me with my experience and
                                responsibilities. He let me and other project partners have an open discussion about the
                                game, and would listen to everything we had to offer when it came to project ideas,
                                problem solving, and any additions we thought of adding to the project. As well, if
                                there were any questions that I had about the project, he would communicate that with me
                                in a quick and timely manner. There were no communication gaps, and our communication
                                was very thorough and understanding, leaving no room for miscommunication.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Working with Lucas was great because even if I or any partners involved in the project
                                had any questions after class, he would take the time out of his day to stay later and
                                discuss what topics were brought up, or any questions anyone had about the project. I
                                feel very grateful having Lucas as a Tech Lead because I felt like he knew everything
                                when it came to the programming side, and was able to come up with quick solutions to
                                any problems that occurred.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For these reasons, if I had the chance to, I would definitely work with Lucas on a
                                future project."
