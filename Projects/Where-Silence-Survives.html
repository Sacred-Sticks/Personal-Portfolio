                    Where Silence Survives is my first virtual reality project that came to completion. It was created
                    during a game jam in which we almost entirely ignored the jam's theme (Single Use). I came into this
                    jam with a gameplay loop concept and forced the theme of the jam to work with it. I had just been
                    watching Daredevil and was fascinated with the concept behind him and wanted to create a virtual
                    reality game matching it, so that's what we did. Come into this game where you can perceive things
                    only when they or something near it makes sound and fight Medusas to stay alive.

                        In this project I was in charge of the blindness mechanic. I had experimented with it before and
                        found that it's possible to create it by removing all the lights in the scene and instantiating
                        them where and when something makes a sound. We could then modify the position and luminosity
                        strength of the object to get the effect we were looking for.

                    <li>
                        I also worked with the AI of the enemies, creating a pathfollowing system in which they each had
                        an active path and a set of combat points. They would by default maneuver around the active path
                        in a clean route predefined by us, but when a player gets discovered by the AI, either by
                        attacking the AI from behind or by walking in front of them, they move towards the most nearby
                        combat point.

                        Throughout development there weren't that many problems except for what I thought was joystick
                        drift on my controller. The lights would be entirely out due to a lack of noise so I would
                        activate the finger snapping and find that I had moved since the last finger snap. However,
                        after releasing the game at the end of the game jam, many comments let me know that this issue
                        was not joystick drift but rather a physics bug.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        We had issues with heights when the game was released as well. Essentially, when a player would
                        walk down stairs, if they were actively holding a weapon they wouldn't lower with the floor
                        while going down the stairs.

                    <li class="text-primary">
                        The physics drift problem was quite unique, as I was struggling to debug it due to the low
                        lights. Because there were no directional lights in the scene to make it visible to see what was
                        going on, it was difficult to see when the issue was happenning. Because of this, I added a
                        directional light to let me see better, and I couldn't see anything bad happening at all. I was
                        suddenly having no drift. I had to think about it for an hour or so until I tried turning the
                        luminosity on the light to 0, but still leaving it in the scene. Suddenly, the physics drift
                        issue was gone.

                    <li class=" text-primary">
                        We had used a package in this virtual reality project called Autohand. This packaged provided
                        hand and finger functionality for grabbing things, and also the character controller, so our
                        issue must have been there. I looked at the components being used and realized we left a stabber
                        on the swords. The stabber would allow for users to stab into walls and climb upwards similar to
                        rock climbing. Leaving this on the swords meant that if you held a sword you wouldn't drop. From
                        this, I learned to only add components when I have the feature fully implemented, as later in
                        development we decided to not include this feature.
