                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    Hybrid Havoc was a game that I designed and pitched for my university capstone class, Media Arts &
                    Game Design 488, Team Projects. Ultimately, the class did not select my pitch as the class project
                    so when the next game jam came and the theme was "Over the Top" I thought it would be over the top
                    to attempt the whole thing in 48 hours, with cuts of course.
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    The gameplay is simple, the player and up to three friends will battle each other in a free for all,
                    top down, local asymmetric multiplier. More in depth, players would have the opprotunity to mutate
                    into a hybrid with a more powerful attack. To win the game, you need to survive as the hybrid for an
                    extended period of time, but there can only be one at a time. Whenever the hybrid is killed, timers
                    reset on all living players for their turn at becoming the hybrid.

                    Hybrid Havoc was produced during a game jam. Due to my group not working out I had left it after 5
                    hours, which had cut deeply into my 48 hour time frame. At that point, everyone was already grouped
                    up so I needed to work on a solo project. I utilizd my Kickstarter package heavily to make
                    production easier.

                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    Being in a solo project meant cutting many aspects of the original Team Projects pitch for Hybrid
                    Havoc. The art was the biggest cut due to this limitation which is why the game doesn't have any
                    animations and still uses primatives for the players, bullets, and walls. I've always developed with
                    the mindset of making it functional first, and only worrying about making it looking pretty after I
                    know it's fun which is why I only had time to model the floors of the game.

                    <li class="text-primary">
                        Many issues that I faced in this project development were actually results of things I had
                        originally overlooked in my Kickstarter package. For instance, I set up the package to allow
                        disabling of input if a player dies, but that disabled the input for all players. Another issue
                        was that the first player to become the hybrid would always have control of the hybrid.

                <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Lessons Learned</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        Fixing the inputs had two solutions, and when they are implemented together it solves any issues
                        I was facing. The first solution was to include an UnsubscribeToInputAction() method in the
                        input object. This would replace disabling the input, which was quite a large overlooked feature
                        that I somehow didn't consider beforehand. The second solution was to add an interface to input
                        receivers. This ensured that they each had the required methods to control and use inputs.

                        I began learning the SOLID design principles about a year or so before this game jam took place,
                        and I was shocked when working that I had performed many of the principles automatically without
                        needing to think to do it. For example, when I was working on the weapon, I started with an
                        IWeapon interface containing an Attack() method. I built my combat system according to the Open
                        Closed Principle without even thinking about it. The further into the project I got, the more
                        design principles I had 'accidentally' used.
