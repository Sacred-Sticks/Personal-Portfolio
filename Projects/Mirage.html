                    Created for the Global Game Jam 2022, themed under Duality. The concept of the game is that your
                    ship captured an alien that can warp perception of nearby individuals and it escaped. You can't
                    trust that you're seeing the ship accurately, but luckily you have a scanner built into your visor
                    that overpowers the beast's abilities. Explore this puzzling ship as you find a way to ensure that
                    the creature can't escape to Earth: at any cost.
                </p>

                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    I was in charge of a lot of the programming, especially considering the visor scanning mechanic. I
                    had a partner in this jam who worked heavily on level design to make it look as filled as it does.
                    The other significant section of my work was the AI for the beast. I programmed it to follow the
                    player with a NavMesh but the attack was more complex because we wanted a jumpscare.

                        We were troubled with how we could acheive the dual perspective of the ship scanning mechanic.

                        Development for the AI of the beast was tricky to nail down, as we wanted to implement a
                        jumpscare and we also understood that some players may not understand the scanning mechanic.

                <ol>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        I had settled on using two builds of the ship, one considered to be the real ship, while the
                        other is the illusion that the beast is projecting into your mind. The player entirely existed
                        in the real ship with their transform, scanning camera, and colliders but we shifted the players
                        primary camera down through a position offset to the illusion ship. Then we just used a custom
                        shader for the render texture that passed accross the screen and we had the effect we desired,
                        though at the cost of lag with multiple cameras rendering full resolution at the same time.
                    </li>
                    <li class=" text-primary">
                        To ensure that players understood the scanning mechanic, we locked all controls until after the
                        player commits the first scan, where they would be looking directly at the beast. This would let
                        them know that they can't trust their eyes for the details about the ship around them. From
                        here, we wanted the beast to have to wait slightly before committing to the attack, so we
                        required not only that the beast must be within range of the player, but also that it can't be
                        an instant attack by requiring a satisfaction of a small timer delay to be more friendly to the
                        players.
