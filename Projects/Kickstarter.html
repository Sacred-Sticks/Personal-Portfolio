                    This project initially began as simply deciding to explore reusable code, but over time it developed
                    into a package of code produced with the intention of making it as reusable as possible. It contains
                    code for event based inputs using the Unity Event System package, UI using the UI Toolkit, data
                    serialization to external files for saving and loading, game events through an event manager as well
                    as scriptable object event busses, animation controls, as well as scriptable object variables to
                    make decoupling easier for some systems.

                    I created this package over the course of about six months using the Unity Game Engine as my
                    starting point. The entire package is created by my own work, though I did outsource help for custom
                    editors from Stack Overflow as I'm unfamiliar with programming custom unity editors. There are
                    certainly aspects of the package that I consider much higher quality than other sections. However,
                    there are some, such as the inputs section that I consider top quality of my work.

                        My biggest problem was working with some of the components of the Unity Engine I was previously
                        unfamiliar with. I had experience with the new Unity Input system package but never had explored
                        programming the input actions manually instead of using an action map. Learning curves aren't
                        necessarily the death of a project though, and they certainly didn't stop me.

                        I found that my ideal solution was to look at the documentation. Through that, I could
                        understand how the team at Unity intend for their systems to work, which let me build on top of
                        it with my own. When I was adding multiplayer inputs for example, I found that I needed to
                        disambiguate between the controllers so that the computer knows when inputs are changing such as
                        a joystick adjusting it's direction without directly stopping. It did take me about a week to
                        find the documentation for this, but when it was implemented the multiplayer inputs worked
                        flawlessly.
