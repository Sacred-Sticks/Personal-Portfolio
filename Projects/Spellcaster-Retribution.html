                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    Spellcaster - Retribution is a game I created with 2 university friends during a game jam in which
                    the theme was "two is better than one." We applied the theme through the use of magic, in which the
                    player could cast two spells at a time, one with each hand, in this virtual reality rogue-lite game.
                    To cast spells, a player would hold the primary button on their controller while moving their hand
                    in a primary direction (up, down, left, or right) to select a spell, and then with a spell selected
                    they could activate it with the trigger.

                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    For this game jam, I had prepared the barebones for a procedural dungeon generator over the previous
                    3 weeks when not working on classwork with the intention of making a roguelite game. Due to this
                    being the first time it was really used, most of my time was spent fixing the code in the
                    generation. I was the only person in the team with experience working in virtual reality
                    development, this meant working with my teammates and showing them some of the solutions I had found
                    for some common issues I had previously encountered.

                <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Challenges Faced</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        The biggest challenge was the dungeon generator. In an ideal world, it would have worked right
                        away but as one might expect, it never does. The challenges consisted of the tiled assets being
                        placed in the wrong spots due to positional offsets, the walls requiring additional rotations,
                        and z-fighting.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        My partner on the tech side was working far more on the actual gameplay while I was working on
                        the dungeon generation and a few of the powers. He had an issue with the spell selection. He
                        couldn't find a way to find the spell based specifically on the direction the hand moved
                        relative to the player. In other words, he was working with global directions but needed local
                        directions.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Lessons Learned</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        The dungeon generator taught me that I can't build systems without assets and expect them to
                        work flawlessly when I import assets to work with them. That's why the position and rotation
                        needed fixing, I was using the default Unity cube which has a root at the center and no
                        textures meanwhile the assets I got from the artist had a root at the bottom and textures only
                        on the side that the player sees. I also learned that sometimes a creative artist can fix
                        problems in engine, because I never got the chance to fix the z-fighting, the artist built the
                        model to avoid it.
                    </li>
                    <li class=" text-primary">
                        To solve the directions problem, I informed my teammate that we could take the forward euler
                        angles from the camera and project it onto the y-plane. With this vector, we were able to
                        calculate the local directions that the hands moved and assign the correct spell accordingly.
