                    We really wanted a challenge on this project, so we went a bit high in scope for the brief six weeks
                    of development. Embark on a journey as Johnny Toymaker as he tries to open a new toyshop, but is far
                    busier than he had expected. Good luck balancing the time as you try to fulfill each order! Be
                    careful though, if your order list fills all 8 slots and a new order comes in, the business is
                    doomed to fail. If you fail to fill an order, it stays in a slot but can no longer be removed by
                    filling it, so you need to keep up and work on your skills with multitasking to ensure that you can
                    keep yourself afloat.

                    On this project I was the programmer and technical engineer. I had planned out and implemented the
                    higher structured systems such as the Toy Production. I used my skills in programming patterns as
                    well as polymorphism to create my toy production factory. This was easily my most advanced system in
                    this project, and my most prized work as a game developer through my career at the point of
                    development.

                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    I also was implementing the UI systems to work with the orders and customers. I used the UI Toolkit
                    to achieve this, as I find it easier to develop layered UI systems in the toolkit as compared to the
                    legacy UI system in Unity. This was quite a time consuming process of refinement until I found a
                    layout that worked nicely with the level design and showed all the necessary information regarding
                    the elements of each toy.

                    <li class="text-primary">
                        Initially the game was designed to have left click insert or remove a resource from a
                        workstation, with the right click actually activating the workstation. However, when it came
                        time to get play tests, we found that those controls were overcomplicated and unnecessary.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        I needed to design the system for producing toys with multiple steps and multiple stations being
                        used. This took a lot of thought and research before I found a set of programming patterns that
                        I could combine to create the functionality I was looking for.

                <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Lessons Learned</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        I was smart enough to really adhere to the SOLID design principles on this project, and so that
                        meant that when it came to refactor the input management to only use one input instead of 2
                        inputs being used 3 times (left click to insert a product, right click to activate the
                        workstation, and left click again to remove it). I spent only about 30 minutes working on the
                        refactor, which included the design process of considering how to solve the problem we were
                        presented with.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        I knew immediately that I use polymorphism to format the toy structure. I had a base
                        class Resource that everything inherits from and adds to. BaseMaterial adds a color, as do
                        the others as needed. As for the structure of the workstations, I used the Factory and Command
                        Patterns. Each workstation has a WorkstationType enum value on it which it sends to the Factory
                        to get the appropriate command for what that workstation does. This made it easy to add new
                        workstations later in development that weren't initially considered like the Trash Can or the
                        Sales Register without needing to modify the workstation class at all.
