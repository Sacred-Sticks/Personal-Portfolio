                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    Blacksite Theta is a University of Wisconsin-Whitewater capstone project that I was lucky enough to
                    be able to work on. The game used an alien creature imbedded into your characters arms to give you
                    control over unique abilities based around growth and retraction of your arms, super strength, and
                    electricity. You had to navigate and survive through a series of puzzles to reach the ending of the
                    game.

                <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Contributions and Responsibilities</h4>
                <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                    I was working primarily in the tech team of the Blacksite Theta, though I also did work in the
                    design of the project. A majority of my time during development was spent on the character
                    controller, as it needed to work well alone while also being compatible with the movement abilities
                    that player had. I was also contributing to the abilities themselves, as I had fully developed the
                    growth and retraction abilities, the strength rebound and the shattering of the smashed crates, and
                    heavily refactored the electric abilities to work with larger systems.

                <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Challenges Faced</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        There were many challenges during development, some of which were quick to solve but the ones
                        that stand out were far larger. We needed to allow for abilities to cancel the character
                        movement when they controllled the movement with the Retraction, Rebound, and Dash abilities.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        Another large problem was the animations of the player, as we wanted the arms to move
                        specifically to the place where they were being used, such as actually hitting the crates that
                        are being smashed. Lastly, grounding animations and airborne animations were tricky, as my
                        controller wasn't created with ramped surfaces being considered as far as animations were
                        considered. This led to the airborne animation triggerring falsely when walking up or down a
                        ramped surface. Unfortunately, I was unable to perfect the ramp issue when development finished.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <div class="border-top border-bottom mt-4 mb-4"></div>
                <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Lessons Learned</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-primary">
                        Luckily, I was learning the SOLID design principles in another class during this project, which
                        made it possible for me to use those lessons throughout development. I learned how important it
                        is to decouple code to keep systems separate and allow for expansion. Originally, we only had
                        two player powersets in mind, the growth and strength powers, and later added the electric
                        abilities. I learned how to develop my character controller to allow for more abilities to be
                        added without needing to modify the code of it for each movement ability using events.
                    </li>
                    <li class=" text-primary">
                        I also had been learning the basics of inverse kinematics for another class working on a virtual
                        reality full body avatar. That knowledge made it easy for me to implement the arm ability
                        animations in such a way to where they would be aimed correctly at the point of interaction.

                                "Throughout the creation of Blacksite Theta, Lucas played a central role in its
                                development. His expertise with the Unity Engine spanned a wide range of
                                responsibilities including design, system architecture, animation controller management,
                                quality assurance testing, and much more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of Lucas’s primary responsibilities was the player controller, which demanded unique
                                and intricate physics support. This was a challenge he adeptly and successfully
                                accomplished. Overall, Lucas was able to consistently offer support to various aspects
                                of the project throughout development. Thanks to his dedication, persistence, and
                                determination, we as a team were able to complete the project in the designated
                                timeline.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’ve also had the pleasure of collaborating with Lucas on numerous projects, ranging
                                from large teams to smaller, two-person teams with each project being an overall great
                                experience.

                                "At the end of working on Blacksite Theta, the project tech lead and I were reflecting
                                on how the project had gone. We both agreed that we wouldn’t have been able to complete
                                the project without Lucas. Right from the beginning, Lucas took charge of the
                                physics-based movement system for the player.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was easily the most challenging system to program in the game, and Lucas dedicated
                                himself to working through all various twists and turns that come with such an endeavor.
                                This alone would have made Lucas one of the most valuable members of the team. In
                                addition to this, whenever he wasn’t working on the movement system, he was quick to
                                help out with other areas of the project including helping team members with less
                                experience when they ran into trouble.

                                I would be more than happy to have Lucas on any team I worked on in the future."
