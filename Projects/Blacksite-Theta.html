            <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                Blacksite Theta is a University of Wisconsin-Whitewater capstone project that I was lucky enough to be
                able to work on. The game used an alien creature imbedded into your characters arms to give you control
                over unique abilities based around growth and retraction of your arms, super strength, and electricity.
                You had to navigate and survive through a series of puzzles to reach the ending of the game.

            <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Contributions and Responsibilities</h4>
            <p class="text-indent text-primary">
                I was working primarily in the tech team of the Blacksite Theta, though I also did work in the design of
                the project. A majority of my time during development was spent on the character controller, as it
                needed to work well alone while also being compatible with the movement abilities that player had. I was
                also contributing to the abilities themselves, as I had fully developed the growth and retraction
                abilities, the strength rebound and the shattering of the smashed crates, and heavily refactored the
                electric abilities to work with larger systems.

            <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Challenges Faced</h4>
            <ol>
                <li class="text-primary">
                    There were many challenges during development, some of which were quick to solve but the ones that
                    stand out were far larger. We needed to allow for abilities to cancel the character movement when
                    they controllled the movement with the Retraction, Rebound, and Dash abilities.
                </li>
                <li class="text-primary">
                    Another large problem was the animations of the player, as we wanted the arms to move specifically
                    to the place where they were being used, such as actually hitting the crates that are being smashed.
                    Lastly, grounding animations and airborne animations were tricky, as my controller wasn't created
                    with ramped surfaces being considered as far as animations were considered. This led to the airborne
                    animation triggerring falsely when walking up or down a ramped surface. Unfortunately, I was unable
                    to perfect the ramp issue when development finished.

            <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Lessons Learned</h4>
            <ol>
                <li class="text-primary">
                    Luckily, I was learning the SOLID design principles in another class during this project, which made
                    it possible for me to use those lessons throughout development. I learned how important it is to
                    decouple code to keep systems separate and allow for expansion. Originally, we only had two player
                    powersets in mind, the growth and strength powers, and later added the electric abilities. I learned
                    how to develop my character controller to allow for more abilities to be added without needing to
                    modify the code of it for each movement ability using events.
                </li>
                <li class=" text-primary">
                    I also had been learning the basics of inverse kinematics for another class working on a virtual
                    reality full body avatar. That knowledge made it easy for me to implement the arm ability animations
                    in such a way to where they would be aimed correctly at the point of interaction.

                                "At the end of working on Blacksite Theta, the project tech lead and I were reflecting
                                on how the project had gone. We both agreed that we wouldn’t have been able to complete
                                the project without Lucas. Right from the beginning, Lucas took charge of the
                                physics-based movement system for the player.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was easily the most challenging system to program in the game, and Lucas dedicated
                                himself to working through all various twists and turns that come with such an endeavor.
                                This alone would have made Lucas one of the most valuable members of the team. In
                                addition to this, whenever he wasn’t working on the movement system, he was quick to
                                help out with other areas of the project including helping team members with less
                                experience when they ran into trouble.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I would be more than happy to have Lucas on any team I worked on in the future."
