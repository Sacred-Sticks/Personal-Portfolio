                <span class="text-indent text-primary">
                    After graduating from university I decided to work on my own solo project while searching for a job
                    to keep my skills sharp and even refine my skills in the Unity physics engine. To do this, I initially
                    started working on a game I called Dodge-Bots, which was a robotic trampoline dodgeball. I realized
                    quickly that I wouldn't be able to create the online multiplayer that I desired and so I redesigned
                    the game in such a way that I could keep the trampoline physics I had developed. From this, Parogue
                    Heights was born. This is a physics based platformer-roguelike in which you gain spells and use those
                    spells to gain height through actions like a dash, back-dash, hookshot, launch, and bounce-pads (the 
                    trampolines).
                </span>

                <h4 class="text-secondary text-center">Contributions and Responsibilities</h4>
                <span class="text-indent text-primary">
                    I created all of the code contained within the project. I did use external sources for some tools, such
                    as my asynchronous scene-loading bootstrapper which I found online and took the time to understand how
                    it worked. However, any gameplay elements such as the inventory, character controller, spells, UI, and
                    more were programmed by myself over the course of a few months.

                <span class="text-indent text-primary"></p>
                    I would practice rapid prototyping on this project. I gathered a group of fellow game developers into an
                    online server with myself and I would try to send out a new prototype every two weeks at the most. Each
                    prototype would have a variety of changes, such as recreating the airborne movement system to interfere
                    less with the spells, as well as new features. All of the prototypes are still actively accessible on
                    my personal <a href="https://sacred-sticks.itch.io/parogue_heights" class="itch-link">Itch page.</a>

                        <p>
                            I knew from the very beginning that I wanted my inventory system to be very robust and 
                            resistant to new spells being added later in development. My initial plan for the
                            inventory was a very simple system in which I would declare an integer variable for
                            each spell type to count the amount of each that I had. Of course, this does not scale
                            at all, as for any new spells that I added later in development I would have needed to
                            go back to the inventory system and modify it, breaking the Open-Closed Principle.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I needed a system in which I could load in pieces of the level procedurally so that
                            every playthrough could be unique. Throughout developing this section of the game I
                            faced a variety of problems, such as my third-person camera colliding with the walls
                            and making it nearly impossible to see anything. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also had issues ensuring that an appropriate amount of level would be generated 
                            when the player nears the top. I couldn't have the game load in too much too early,
                            as that could cause significant lag. I needed it to manage itself without overworking
                            the hardware.

                            Interfaces... I love interfaces. I used an ISpell interface to declare that a class 
                            was a type of spell. From there, whenever the player would collect a new spell, my 
                            inventory would check if it already has an inventory slot with that type of spell to 
                            add to the total count, if not it would create a new one. Each inventory slot would
                            simply hold data to be accessible from the inventory system. This allowed me to build
                            a dynamic inventory which required absolutely no modification when I later added two
                            more spells, the forwards and back-dash. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                            I had actually shown one of my later prototypes, I believe it was prototype 6, at a
                            game development expo and somebody who has far more experience than me pointed out
                            a perfect solution to my camera problem. All I needed to do was modify the LayerMask
                            of collisions that the VirtualCamera would collide against to no longer include the
                            walls, and then modify the wall models to no longer have a backside. This ensured that
                            the camera would not be messed up by the existence of the walls, as it now is unaware
                            of the walls entirely.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           As for loading in a proper amount of the level at a time, I created a trigger box which
                           was quite tall and placed it at a height of 0. That way the player would begin within the
                           trigger, triggering it immediately. When triggered, it instantiates new sections of the
                           tower selecting randomly from an appropriate array of prefabs and places them at their
                           respective heights, and then moves itself to be halfway up the newly built sections height.
                           This way, I know that it's high enough where it can still be triggered again, but not too
                           high where the player can see the top of the tower when they trigger it. 
                        </p>
